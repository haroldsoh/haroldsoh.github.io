An important part of why I became an academic is to teach. I've had (and continue to have) the amazing opportunity to interact with many wonderful students over the years. 

My objective as a teacher is help my students become independent thinkers with three core proficiencies:
- the ability to ``think like a computer scientist'' and rigorously analyze  problems,
- the capacity to draw upon fundamental concepts in computer science to conceptualize and implement working solutions,
- the capability to clearly communicate results and ideas (both written and oral).

Regardless of their eventual career choice, I believe these skills will remain relevant to students long after they have left my classroom. 

Over the past three years, I have developed and taught four courses at the core undergraduate level (CS2040/S - Data Structures and Algorithms) and graduate levels (CS5340 - Uncertainty Modeling in AI, CS6281 - Human-Centered AI) and an advanced topics course on Human-Robot Interaction (CS6244).
