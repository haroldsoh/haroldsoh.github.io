## For Students

**If you’re a NUS graduate student in CS looking for a supervisor**, [email me](mailto:harold@comp.nus.edu.sg) indicating your research interests along with a CV. Have a look at the [CLeAR website](https://clear-nus.github.io) for the work we do.

**If you’re a NUS undergraduate student**, [email me](mailto:harold@comp.nus.edu.sg) and mention you’re interested in a FYP or UROP project. I sometimes hire NUS interns during term-time and summer break, but this depends on availability of projects and funds.

**If you’re not a NUS student**, then please apply first. I’m typically unable to work with you unless you’re a NUS student or an official exchange student. Please note that admission decisions are made by the department so, I am unable to guarantee you a place in the PhD/Masters program.

**If you’re _not_ a NUS or exchange student**, I’m afraid I’m unable to accommodate you at the moment. Please do not send  me emails asking for summer internships. I receive too many of such emails and am unable to respond to each of them individually.
