## Brief Biography

Harold Soh is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, where he leads the Collaborative Learning and Adaptive Robots (CLeAR) group. He completed his Ph.D. at Imperial College London, focusing on online learning for assistive robots. 

Harold's research primarily involves machine learning, particularly generative AI, and decision-making in trustworthy collaborative robots. His contributions have been recognized with a R:SS Early Career Spotlight in 2023, best paper awards at IROS'21 and T-AFFC'21, and several nominations (R:SS'18, HRI'18, RecSys'18, IROS'12). Harold has played significant roles in the HRI community, most recently as co-Program Chair of ACM/IEEE HRI'24. He is an Associate Editor for the ACM Transactions on Human Robot Interaction, Robotics Automation and Letters (RA-L), and the International Journal on Robotics Research (IJRR). He serves as Associate Director of the NUS AI Lab (NUSAIL) and is a Principal Investigator at the Smart Systems Institute. He is also a co-founder of TacnIQ, a startup developing intelligent e-skins.

Harold lives in Singapore with his wife and two lovely children. In his precious free time, he enjoys reading science fiction with a glass of wine.
