Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://comp.nus.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}, [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg){:target="_blank"} (NUS), where I direct the [Collaborative, Learning, and Adaptive Robots (CLeAR)](https://clear-nus.github.io/trust){:target="_blank"} Lab.   

> My goal is to improve people's lives through intelligent robotics.

During my graduate studies, I built [smart wheelchairs for children with disabilities](https://www.technologyreview.com/2012/09/28/183560/a-smart-safe-wheelchair-for-kids-who-cant-walk/){:target="_blank"} and more recently, I've been exploring how robots can assist the elderly. In general, I'm interested in [trustworthy collaborative robots](https://clear-nus.github.io/trust){:target="_blank"} that help people at work, at play, and at home. 

I believe better robot behavior can be achieved by improving robot perception and intelligence. My main tools are in machine learning, encompassing both probabilistic modeling and deep learning. I'm particularly fond of [deep generative models](https://clear-nus.github.io/generativemodels){:target="_blank"} that enable robots to have imagination and simulate possible futures. I also run human-robot-interaction (HRI) experiments to gain inspiration and validate that our methods actually work with people. Together with my team at [CLeAR](https://clear-nus.github.io){:target="_blank"}, we're developing robots that learn from humans, [robots that humans trust](https://clear-nus.github.io/trust){:target="_blank"}, and [robots that have a sense of touch](https://clear-nus.github.io/tactile){:target="_blank"}.
